* Load profile under terminal
  Ref: [[https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51036/what-is-the-difference-between-bash-profile-and-bashrc][.bash_profile vs .bashrc]]
  1. .bash_profile, .profile are used for interactive login mode
     - .profile is not limited to bash
     - bash will search .bash_profile, then .profile
  2. .bashrc is used for interactive non-login mode
     - non-login: e.g., after login, we open new terminal window
  3. In MacOS, terminal is usually in interactive login mode
  4. How to load the /dotprofile.template/ without repeat:
     We can put them into our .bash_profile or .bashrc
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     if [ -f $DOTPROFILE ]
     then
         source $DOTPROFILE
     fi
     #+END_SRC
  5. If planning to keep .bash_profile and .bashrc with the same enviroments,
     we can let write the codes above in .bash_profile, and source .bash_profile
     in .bashrc or vice versa.
